# Safety

Safety is the most important thing to remember when working with electrical and pneumatic components. This page has lots of information about how to stay safe when working. If you have **any** questions about safety please bring them up to the safety captain. ***This document is neither complete nor official, it should only be used as a general reference.***

## Soldering

Not practicing safety when soldering is one of the easiest ways to get hurt in electronics. Soldering irons heat to hundreds of degrees Celsius. **ALWAYS** treat a soldering iron as if it was on. If you have long hair, tie it back. If you do end up burning yourself, let the safety captain know and they will be able to help you treat it with burn cream. 

Solder typically contains lead. It is for this reason that you **NEVER** eat while soldering, and always wash your hands after coming into contact with solder or soldering related tools. Soldering also releases solder fumes which also contain lead. Make sure to avoid breathing fumes, and wear safety glasses to prevent anything getting in your eyes. Ingesting or inhaling lead can and will result in lead poisoning, which you probably don't want.

## Electronics

When working on electrical components **ALWAYS** ensure that the system or component you are working on is **OFF.** Keep your hair and any loose articles of clothing away from any moving components such as motors, gearboxes, and other mechanisms. **WEAR SAFETY GLASSES** when running electrical components.

When working with batteries **DO NOT BRIDGE TERMINALS OR BATTERY WIRES.** This is not only unsafe, but can damage our batteries as well. You will probably know if this happens, as it typically emits sparks. In general, **do not** bridge wires or connections unless you know what you are doing.

## Pneumatics

Pneumatics may seem pretty safe, but they are extremely powerful and capable of doing serious damage. **WEAR SAFETY GLASSES** when running a pneumatic system.

**NEVER** blow compressed air in your ears. **THIS WILL CAUSE HEARING DAMAGE.** As a general rule to prevent this, refrain from blowing compressed air at someone's face.

**NEVER** intentionally cause something to be shot out of a pneumatic system. You do not know where an object shot out of a pneumatic system will go, and it can hit somebody.

**NEVER** point cylinders at any person in such a way that it could hit any part of their body or pin any part of their body against something.
