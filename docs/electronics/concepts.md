# Concepts

These are some concepts you will be expected to know, as they are a fundamental part of understanding how an electrical system functions.

## Ohm's Law

Ohm's Law, put simply, is the equation **V = IR**, where V is voltage, I is amperage, and R is resistance.

In order to understand Ohm's Law, you need to understand what voltage, amperage, and resistance are.

### Voltage

Voltage is the measure of potential difference in the charge of the positive and negative terminals of a system. This is measured in Volts (V).


### Amperage

Amperage is the magnitude of the charge being transferred. This is measured in Amps or Amperes (A).

### Resistance

Resistance is the measure of opposition to the flow of an electrical current. This is measured in Ohms (Î©).

## Circuits

Depending on how circuits are wired, the amperage, voltage, and resistance can change at certain points. In this section we will explore the concepts of parallel and series circuits.

### Parallel Circuits

If you have two batteries wired into a circuit in parallel, the total amperage of the circuit will be the sum of the amperage of the batteries.

In this theoretical parallel circuit, the positive terminals of both batteries will be connected to the same wire, this wire will serve as the positive wire for the circuit. The same goes for the negative wire, it will be connected to the negative terminal of both batteries.

### Series Circuits

If you have two batteries wired into a circuit in series, the total voltage of the circuit will be the sum of the voltage of the batteries.

In this theoretical circuit, the negative terminal of battery 1 serves as the negative terminal for the whole circuit. The positive terminal of battery 1 is connected to the negative terminal of battery 2. The positive terminal of battery 2 serves as the positive terminal for the whole circuit.
