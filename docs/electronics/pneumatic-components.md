# Pneumatic System Components

!!! note "Note:"
    Unlike electrical components, we will not use pneumatics every year. The decision of whether or not we use pneumatics ultimately comes down to how we decide to approach the year's game.

Below are several pneumatic system components that you may be working with on our robots.

## Compressor

The compressor is the starting point for every pneumatics system. It compresses air into the accumulators for use in the pneumatic system.

## Accumulator

The accumulator(s) store compressed air for future use in the pneumatic system. They hold up to 125 PSI, however we regulate stored pressure to about 120 to be safe. Pressure coming out of the accumulator to the rest of the system should be regulated to 60 PSI.

## Regulator

Pressure regulators regulate how much pressure is allowed in a certain part of the pneumatics system. We typically have one regulator before the accumulator set to 120 PSI (stored pressure), and one after the accumulator set to 60 PSI (working pressure).

## Pressure Gauge

The pressure gauge displays the PSI of the section it is placed in the pneumatic system. We typically put these right after regulators.
