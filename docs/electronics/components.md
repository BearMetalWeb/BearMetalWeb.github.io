# Electrical System Components

Below are several electrical system components that you may be working with on our robots.

## PDH

The Power Distribution Hub (PDH) distributes power from the battery throughout the robot's electrical system. We typically use the PDH due to it's ports being easier to open, it having a native voltage display, and other features not available on the PDP.

## PDP

The Power Distribution Panel (PDP) serves the same purpose as the PDH. We don't typically use the PDP on competition robots due to the fact that it lacks features available on the PDH.

## VRM

The Voltage Regulator Module (VRM) is used to regulate voltage, specifically to components that require less power and use smaller gauge wire.

## Five-Star

The Five-Star allows CAN to be routed to other components individually rather than in a daisy chain.

## Radio

The Radio allows the robot to be controlled wirelessly through the driver's station. Below is an image of the new radio that will become standard for the 2025 season.

## RPM

The Radio Power Module (RPM) is used to easily splice power into an ethernet cable, which will be used to power the radio using PoE (Power over Ethernet.)
