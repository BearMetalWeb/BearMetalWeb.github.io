Be careful when running NEO 550s, they are outrunner motors, which means that the shell of the motor rotates along with the shaft. The most obvious difference between NEO v1.1 motors and NEO 550s is that NEO v1.1 motors are significantly larger and have much more torque. NEO 550 and NEO v1.1 motors also use different size wires for power. NEO 550s use 16AWG wire for power, and NEO v1.1 motors use 12AWG wire for power.</p> <p>NEO v1.1:</p> <p></p> <p>NEO 550:</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"electronics/motors/#spark-max","title":"Spark MAX","text":"<p>\ud83d\udcdd Note:</p> <p>It is unlikely for us to use this component on competition robots due to us transitioning to using Krakens, but it might be used during prototyping.</p> <p>The Spark MAX is a motor controller that we use for both NEO v1.1 motors and NEO 550s.</p> <p></p>"}]}
