Be careful when running NEO 550s, they are outrunner motors, which means that the shell of the motor rotates along with the shaft. The most obvious difference between NEO v1.1 motors and NEO 550s is that NEO v1.1 motors are significantly larger and have much more torque. NEO 550 and NEO v1.1 motors also use different size wires for power.
